# Stock Photos 🖼️
> PROD [Live] : https://react-stock-photos-prod.netlify.app/

#### Stock Photos consists of a straightforward user interface where there is a
- List of endless random high-quality images with infinite scroll.
- **Infinite scroll** is handled using JavaScript logic and all the data is handled by Unsplash.
- New images will start appearing with the **Loading** text animation once the user has scrolled down to the bottom of the page. A default of 10 images per page has been set and each image will have some info on mouse hover.
- **Search form** to query for a specific category of images when filled it and press the search icon or enter to submit. The additional functionality is when input is given without submitting and continues scrolling the input-related images will be shown from the following page along with the previous pages. 
- To run the project locally, clone the repo, `npm install` to install the dependencies, and `npm start` to start up the development server on default port 3000.
